    <br>
    <p>Whether you want to start trading stocks actively, or just want to invest for the long-term, there are things you need to know before starting.<br> Knowing what to expect, and what tools you need, will help prepare you so your entry into stock trading goes as smoothly as possible.<br><u> Here are five things to do before you start trading stocks.</u></p>
	<h3><b><u>Acquaint Yourself With the Stock Market</u></b></h3>
    <p>Stocks are small pieces of a company. The stock price (also called a "share") reflects the value of the company, and its outlook, as determined by the people trading the stock (traders and investors).<br> Stocks don't have a set price, they continually fluctuate, each second of each day.</p>
	<h3><b><u>Establish Your Purpose For Trading</u></b></h3>
	<p>Establish what you want out of your trading. Is it something you want to do every day? Do you want to trade a couple of times per week? Possibly doing research at night if you have a full-time job during the day. Or do you want to buy stocks and hold them for the long-term?<br>

		There is no right or wrong here. Do all of them or one of them. Day trading is taking trades that last less than a day and trades often only last minutes.Swing trading is taking trades that last from a day to several weeks.
		Investing is taking trades that last many months or even years. Before deciding which to pursue, consider your finances.</p>
	<h3><b><u>Consider Your Finances</u></b></h3>
	<p>To invest requires less capital. Since the trade is held for a long period of time commissions are not as much of a factor. Therefore you can begin to buy stocks as soon as you can afford 100 shares (stocks typically trade in 100 blocks) of the stock you are interested in. Save money on commissions by making one trade instead of multiple trades. For example, instead of buying 100 shares every week, save the money for a month and make one larger purchase.<br> 
		This only applies if the value of the transaction is small, where the commission could represent a significant percentage of the capital being deployed (more than 1% is significant). On the other hand, if you are buying thousands of rupees worth of stock on each investment the commissions are largely inconsequential.</p>	
	<h3><b><u>Find a Broker and Trading Platform</u></b></h3>
	<p>A broker facilitates trading between market participants, allowing you to buy stocks from sellers and sell stock to buyers (there is a buyer and seller for every transaction).<br>
		There are loads of brokers, some of which are better for investors and some which are better for day traders or swing traders. Picking a broker is the biggest trade of all; all your capital is given to this company.</p>
	<h3><b><u>Practice Before Depositing Money</u></b></h3>
	<p>As you narrow your selection of brokers by playing around in their demo accounts, practice placing trades. Get used to the various order types available. Begin formulating strategies and testing them on historical price charts. Place fake money trades based on those strategies and analyze the findings with statistics to see if the strategy is likely to produce a profit.<br>
		If you can't make a profit trading fake money there is little purpose in wasting real money. On the other hand, producing fake money returns doesn't necessarily mean real money profits will come just as easily. There are differences between demo trading and real trading. Demo trading is still a very valuable tool, though.<br>		
		In the demo account practice proper risk management. Risk management is where you only risk a small amount of the account on any single trade.</p>
