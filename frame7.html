        <h3><b><u>Practice Before Depositing Money</u></b></h3>
	    <p>As you narrow your selection of brokers by playing around in their demo accounts, practice placing trades. Get used to the various order types available. Begin formulating strategies and testing them on historical price charts. Place fake money trades based on those strategies and analyze the findings with statistics to see if the strategy is likely to produce a profit.<br>
		If you can't make a profit trading fake money there is little purpose in wasting real money. On the other hand, producing fake money returns doesn't necessarily mean real money profits will come just as easily. There are differences between demo trading and real trading. Demo trading is still a very valuable tool, though.<br>		
		In the demo account practice proper risk management. Risk management is where you only risk a small amount of the account on any single trade.</p>
