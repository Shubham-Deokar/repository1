        <h3><b><u>Consider Your Finances</u></b></h3>
	    <p>To invest requires less capital. Since the trade is held for a long period of time commissions are not as much of a factor. Therefore you can begin to buy stocks as soon as you can afford 100 shares (stocks typically trade in 100 blocks) of the stock you are interested in. Save money on commissions by making one trade instead of multiple trades. For example, instead of buying 100 shares every week, save the money for a month and make one larger purchase.<br> 
		    This only applies if the value of the transaction is small, where the commission could represent a significant percentage of the capital being deployed (more than 1% is significant). On the other hand, if you are buying thousands of rupees worth of stock on each investment the commissions are largely inconsequential.</p>
