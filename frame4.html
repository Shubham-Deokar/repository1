        <h3><b><u>Establish Your Purpose For Trading</u></b></h3>
	    <p>Establish what you want out of your trading. Is it something you want to do every day? Do you want to trade a couple of times per week? Possibly doing research at night if you have a full-time job during the day. Or do you want to buy stocks and hold them for the long-term?<br>

		There is no right or wrong here. Do all of them or one of them. Day trading is taking trades that last less than a day and trades often only last minutes.Swing trading is taking trades that last from a day to several weeks.
		Investing is taking trades that last many months or even years. Before deciding which to pursue, consider your finances.</p>
