        <h3><b><u>Acquaint Yourself With the Stock Market</u></b></h3>
            <p>Stocks are small pieces of a company. The stock price (also called a "share") reflects the value of the company, and its outlook, as determined by the people trading the stock (traders and investors).<br> Stocks don't have a set price, they continually fluctuate, each second of each day.</p>
