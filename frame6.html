        <h3><b><u>Find a Broker and Trading Platform</u></b></h3>
	    <p>A broker facilitates trading between market participants, allowing you to buy stocks from sellers and sell stock to buyers (there is a buyer and seller for every transaction).<br>
		    There are loads of brokers, some of which are better for investors and some which are better for day traders or swing traders. Picking a broker is the biggest trade of all; all your capital is given to this company.</p>
